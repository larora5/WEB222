        <h3>The History of Pool</h3>
        
        <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="History">
        <p>Pool, also known as pocket billiards, has a rich history that dates back to the 15th century. The game has evolved over time, originating from an outdoor lawn game similar to croquet. As it moved indoors, wooden tables with green cloth were introduced to simulate the grassy playing field. Over the centuries, pool has become one of the most popular cue sports worldwide, with various rule sets and game types emerging.</p>

      <h1>Rules and How to Play</h1>
 
      <img src="images/rules.png" alt="Rules">
      <p>Pool is played on a rectangular table with six pockets, one at each corner and one in the middle of each long side. The game is typically played with two players, using a set of 16 balls â€“ one white cue ball and 15 object balls. The object of the game is to pocket the balls in a specific order or according to specific rules, depending on the type of pool game being played.</p>
      <p>Some common pool games include Eight-Ball, Nine-Ball, Straight Pool, and Snooker. In all pool games, players must strike the cue ball with a cue stick to pocket the object balls. Each player takes turns, and the game continues until a player fulfills the winning condition of the specific game type.</p>
